                We conduct this experiment to see if users of our museum online collection website prefer 
                artworks that were recommended to them over randomly selected ones. There are three 
                different ways how we generate recommendations: one is based on metadata (textual information 
                held about the objects), image data (digital images of the objects), and lastly, a mix of 
                these two. You have just experienced one of the three methods, with either part 1 or part 2 
                being randomly chosen artworks.

                we will get back to you with further information. Please don't share the details of 
                this experiment with others as they may participate and cannot know the true 
                aim of this study.
